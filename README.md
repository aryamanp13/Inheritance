# Inheritance

## Aim:
To understand the concept of inheritance.

## Theory:
Inheritance in C++ allows a derived class to inherit properties and methods from a base class, promoting code reuse and a hierarchical class structure. This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance: One derived class from one base class.

Multiple Inheritance: One derived class from multiple base classes.

Multilevel Inheritance: A class derived from another derived class.

Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple derived classes from one base class.

## Algorithm:

Multiple Inheritance

1.Define Vehicle: Public member company = "Ford"; method type() = "Mustang".

2.Define Specs: Public member mileage = "8 kmph"; method colour() = "Grey".

3.Define Car: Inherits from Vehicle and Specs; public member seater = "4 seater".

4.Main: Create Car object f2, invoke methods and display members.
